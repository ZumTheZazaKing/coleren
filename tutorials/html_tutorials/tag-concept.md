## Elements vs. Tags

Elements are not tags. Some people refer to elements as tag and the other way around but that is simply not the case.

Remember that the element is one thing and the tag (be it start or end tag) is another.


### A Better understanding

For instance, the HEAD element is always present even though the `<head>` tags are missing.

That's the difference between an element and a tag.

Another example would be the following code sample where the `<html>` is not present but the code still works if tested. This is because a HTML document will always have the root HTML element even if the `<html>` tag is missing.
